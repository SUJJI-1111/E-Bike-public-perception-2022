![E-Bike Info](e-bike-info.jpg)
## 📌 Project Overview
In **May 2022**, e-bikes were at the center of public discussion in India.  
A surge of accident reports was making headlines, creating **fear and skepticism** among potential users.  

To capture public sentiment at that moment, I conducted a **primary survey-based research project** as part of my MBA program.  
This project is not about today’s trends but serves as a **time capsule of perceptions in 2022**.  
## 📰 News Headlines (2022)
The study was motivated by heavy media coverage of e-bike accidents:

## 🛠 What I Did
- Designed a structured **questionnaire**  
- Collected **130 responses** from employees across different companies  
- Performed **data cleaning & analysis** in Excel and Python  
- Applied a **Chi-Square Test** to test the relationship between *occupation* and *willingness to adopt e-bikes*  
- Visualized the results with charts for awareness, intention, and impressions  
- Documented the full findings in a research paper

## 📊 Key Insights (2022)
- **94%** of respondents were aware of e-bikes  
- **76%** were aware of accidents involving e-bikes  
- Only **14%** expressed intention to use them in the future → strong reluctance  
- **58%** reported a **negative impression** after hearing accident news  
- Chi-Square Test showed that **occupation influenced willingness to adopt**  

⚡ These findings highlight how **safety perceptions directly impacted adoption decisions** at that time.
